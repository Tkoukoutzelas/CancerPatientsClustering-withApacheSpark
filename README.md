# CancerPatientsClustering-withApacheSpark
The subject of this Project is to test a number of Clusters for about 6 million cancer patients based on data from their examinations, and find the optimal number, based on the Silhouette Score(assignment2.py).
In assignment2_2.py the number of clusters is given during the execution, and its goal is to test whether the number of workers in the Spark Cluster has an effect on metrics, such as The Sum of Squared Errors.
